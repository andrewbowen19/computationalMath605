### Load our Datasets
I uploaded the kaggle datasets to my GitHub, reading them here for reproducability.
```{r}
test_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewbowen19/computationalMath605/main/data/test.csv"
train_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewbowen19/computationalMath605/main/data/train.csv"

test <- read.csv(test_url)
train <- read.csv(train_url)
```
