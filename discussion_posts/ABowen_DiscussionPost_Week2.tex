\textbf{\textit{S.C26}} Show that the set:
\begin{align}
    Y &= \{ \begin{bmatrix}
        x_{1} \\
        x_{2} \\
    \end{bmatrix} |
     x_{1} \in{} \mathbb{Z},
     x_{2} \in{} \mathbb{Z}
    \}
\end{align}

has the property of additive closure: 

\begin{align}
  \Vec{u}, \Vec{v} \in{} \textit{V}, \Rightarrow \Vec{u} + \Vec{v} \in{} \textit{V}
\end{align}

\subsection{Solution}

We know that $\mathbb{Z} \subset{} \mathbb{C}$ by properties of the set of integers. We also know the integers $\mathbb{Z}$ and complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$ are closed under addition by the properties of these sets. Since any member $\Vec{x}$ of Y has integer components, we can add another vector, $\Vec{y} \in{} Y$ to $\Vec{x}$:

\begin{align}
    \Vec{x} + \Vec{y} = \begin{bmatrix}
                            x_{1} \\
                            x_{2}
                        \end{bmatrix}
                        +
                        \begin{bmatrix}
                            y_{1} \\
                            y_{2}
                        \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

Since $x_{1}, x_{2}, y_{1}, y_{2} \in{} \mathbb{Z}$, their component sums $x_{1} + y_{1}$ and $x_{2} + y_{2}$ must also necessarily be integers. Since the sums are also integers du to additive closure of the set of integers, we know the addition of these two members $\Vec{x}, \Vec{y} \in{} Y$ must also be a member of Y
