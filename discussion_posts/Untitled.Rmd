### Exercise 11.1.13
*Write a program to compute $u^{(n)}$ given $\textbf{u}$ and $P$. Use this program to compute $u^{(10)}$ for the Land of Oz example, with $u = (0,1,0)$, and with $u = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3)$.*


First, let's define our transition probability matrix $P$ for each weather type (*Rainy, Sunny, Nice*)
```{r}
# First, define our P matrix
P <- matrix(c(0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5), nrow=3, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)

rownames(P) <- c("R", "N", "S")
colnames(P) <- c("R", "N", "S")

print(P)
```


Based on Theorem 11.2, if $P$ is our transition matrix, Then the probability that the chain is in state $s_i$ after $n$ steps is the $i^{th}$ entry in the vector:

\begin{aligned}
  \textbf{u^{(n)}} = \textbf{u}P^n
\end{aligned}
